# Paypal Addresser

This plugin allows your customers to enter or change the shipping address during
the Paypal Express checkout process and save that address as the order address
in Craft Commerce. It works by making an additional call to Paypal once the user returns
to the Craft Commerce site to retreive the address and saves it to the order.
